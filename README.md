📚 Book Database Analysis Project
This project focuses on SQL-based analysis of a book database to extract meaningful insights and perform data queries efficiently. The dataset includes information about books, genres, and sub-genres with attributes like ratings, prices, and more.

🚀 Features
Retrieve and analyze book data, genres, and sub-genres.
Perform SQL queries to answer business questions, such as:
Most popular genres and sub-genres.
Revenue potential based on listed book prices.
Book-level and genre-level rating analysis.
Optimize SQL queries for real-world database scenarios.
🗂️ Datasets
Books Dataset: Contains book titles, authors, genres, prices, ratings, and URLs.
Genres Dataset: Includes main genres and their associated metadata.
Sub-Genres Dataset: Details sub-genres and their relationships to main genres.
🛠️ Technologies Used
MySQL: For SQL queries and database management.
Python: For data pre-processing and transformations.
🔍 Sample Queries
List all books with a rating greater than 4.0:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM books_df WHERE Rating > 4.0;
Find the most popular main genre:
sql
Copy code
SELECT `Main Genre`, SUM(`No. of People rated`) AS Total_Ratings
FROM books_df
GROUP BY `Main Genre`
ORDER BY Total_Ratings DESC LIMIT 1;
Calculate total revenue potential for each sub-genre:
sql
Copy code
SELECT `Sub Genre`, SUM(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(Price, '₹', ''), ',', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS Revenue
FROM books_df
GROUP BY `Sub Genre`
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
💡 Insights
SQL queries demonstrate how to extract, aggregate, and sort data effectively.
Handling string-based price data and converting it into numeric formats for analysis.
Identifying actionable insights, like popular genres or high-revenue potential sub-genres.
